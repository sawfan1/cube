# Spinning Dodecahedron WebGL

A mesmerizing 3D spinning dodecahedron rendered using WebGL, showcasing the beauty of geometric mathematics in real-time graphics.

## Overview

This project creates an interactive 3D dodecahedron (a polyhedron with 12 pentagonal faces) that continuously rotates in 3D space. Built with pure WebGL for optimal performance and educational purposes, it demonstrates fundamental 3D graphics concepts including vertex buffers, shader programming, and matrix transformations.
